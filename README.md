## Introduction

ARCH (Analysis and Research Compilation of Healthcare Questions) is a versatile tool that aids in the creation of CRFs for healthcare research. It is designed to streamline the process of managing questions, generating data dictionaries, and ensuring data integrity. ARCH consists of two main components:

1. **Library of Questions**: ARCH provides a comprehensive library of questions tailored for various research studies. Each question is structured with essential information, including its format, section, variable name, type, possible answers, validation rules, and more.

2. **Research Question Management**: ARCH helps researchers define research questions and identifies the necessary variables to answer them. It generates data dictionaries that can be seamlessly integrated with data capture systems like REDCap.
