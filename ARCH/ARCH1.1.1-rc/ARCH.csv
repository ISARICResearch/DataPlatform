Meningitis is an inflammatory disease of the leptomeninges, the tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord, and is defined by an abnormal number of white blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within an appropriate clinical context and with or without supportive radiological findings. Encephalitis refers to inflammation of the brain. In comparison with meningitis, in encephalitis, abnormalities in brain function are expected, including altered mental status, motor or sensory deficits, altered behaviour and personality changes, and speech or movement disorders. It is defined by an altered mental status lasting ?24 hours along with two of the following criteria: documented fever >/= 38°C (100.4°F); white blood cell count (WBC) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) >/= 5  cells/mm^3; generalized or partial seizures not fully attributable to a preexisting seizure disorder; new onset of focal neurological findings; presence of compatible acute lesion on neuroimaging; abnormality on electroencephalography that is consistent with encephalitis and not attributable to another cause. As outlined by the 2013 International Encephalitis Consortium. Seizures are defined as an intermittent abnormality of nervous system physiology characterised by a transient occurrence of sudden, violent, irregular movement of the body, caused by involuntary contraction of muscles due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. An established history of epilepsy is not required. Stroke refers to a sudden loss of neurological function secondary to haemorrhage or ischemia in the brain parenchyma due to a vascular event. Stroke may be a clinical diagnosis, with or without supportive radiological findings. Intracranial haemorrhage refers to haemorrhage/bleeding occurring within the skull. Intracranial haemorrhage encompasses four broad types of haemorrhage: epidural haemorrhage, subdural haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, and intraparenchymal haemorrhage. Guillain-Barre syndrome refers to a rapidly progressive autoimmune disorder of the peripheral nervous system characterized by limb paraesthesia, areflexia, and generalized muscle weakness or paralysis that often begins in the legs and spreads to the arms, torso, and face. Required features include progressive weakness of the arms and/or legs, ranging from minimal weakness of the legs to total paralysis of all four limbs, and including the trunk, bulbar and facial muscles, and external ophthalmoplegia; and areflexia or decreased deep tendon reflexes in weak limbs. Supportive features include symptom progression over days to four weeks; Relatively symmetric, bilateral symptoms; Pain in the trunk or limbs; Cranial nerve symptoms or signs; Autonomic dysfunction; Sensory dysfunction that is mild; No fever at symptom onset; CSF with elevated protein and normal to mildly elevated leukocyte count (usually <5 cells/mm3); Electrodiagnostic abnormalities consistent with GBS; Recovery starting two to four weeks after progression halts.","Indicate 'Yes', if the patient experienced this at any time during hospitalisation.",SNOMED,7180009 |Meningitis (disorder)| 45170000 |Encephalitis (disorder)| 81308009 |Disorder of brain (disorder)|41370002 |Myelitis (disorder)|230690007 |Cerebrovascular accident (disorder)|1386000 |Intracranial haemorrhage (disorder)|40956001 |Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) (disorder)|,,,clinical_features,,,1,1,1,1,1,
