    <h1>Data Capture</h1>
    
    <p>Welcome to the Data Capture section of the ISARIC Data Platform. This section is dedicated to the tools designed for acquisition and organization of clinical data, serving as a critical component in our mission to drive global clinical studies and address severe infections and emerging public health threats.</p>

    <h2>ARCH: Analysis and Research Compilation of Healthcare Questions</h2>
    <p>ARCH is a core machine readable file within Data Capture. It plays a vital role in our research efforts by offering a comprehensive library of questions designed to address various outbreaks. ARCH ensures the integrity and reliability of data from the outset, making it a valuable resource for our research community. The tool provides detailed insights into the structure of questions, response types, answer options and validation rules. ARCH, is a foundational component that serves two key purposes.</p>
  
    <h3>1. Library of Questions</h3>

    <p>ARCH hosts a comprehensive library of questions designed to address various outbreaks. This library is meticulously curated to ensure the integrity and reliability of data from the outset. Here is an outline of its structure:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Form:</strong> Provides details about the format of each question.</li>
      <li><strong>Section:</strong> Groups related questions by topic or area within the forms.</li>
      <li><strong>Variable:</strong> Follows a naming convention, typically in the format of section descriptor_question descriptor_modifier. The modifier is optional and used for deeply linked questions.</li>
      <li><strong>Type:</strong> Specifies the type of response expected, including options like radio buttons for multiple-choice questions, numeric inputs, lists, and more.</li>
      <li><strong>Question:</strong> Displays the actual label on the Clinical Report Form (CRF).</li>
      <li><strong>Answer Options:</strong> Lists possible responses to each question.</li>
      <li><strong>Validation:</strong> Provides rules and considerations for filling out each question.</li>
      <li><strong>Minimum/Maximum:</strong> For numeric questions, these define the accepted value range.</li>
      <li><strong>List:</strong> Details the referred list for list-type questions.</li>
      <li><strong>Skip Logic:</strong> Explains how responses to certain questions affect the visibility of subsequent ones.</li>
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Offers key definitions pertinent to specific questions.</li>
      <li><strong>Completion Guideline:</strong> Provides instructions on how to appropriately answer each question.</li>
      <li><strong>Standardized Term Codelist:</strong> Contains a standard medical library for coding and defining variables.</li>
      <li><strong>Multiple Columns for Presets:</strong> Includes different preset columns for specific diseases, with indicators for recommended questions (as 1â€™s in the rows).</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>2. Research Questions</h3>
    <p>In addition to its library of questions, ARCH also hosts a set of research questions. These questions address the most critical issues during epidemics of infections and other rapidly emerging public health threats. They play a crucial role in generating new knowledge and maximizing the availability of fast and robust clinical information.</p>



    <h2>BRIDGE - Biomedical Research Inquiry for Disease Guidance and Epidemiology</h2>
    
    <p>BRIDGE is a software tool that complements ARCH within the Data Capture section of the ISARIC Data Platform. It is designed to streamline the process of generating Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) for research studies.</p>
    
    <p>BRIDGE takes the elements of ARCH's comprehensive library of questions and empowers researchers to efficiently select and customize questions that are relevant to a specific study. Researchers can use BRIDGE to check the questions that align with their research objectives, ensuring that the data collected is tailored to the study's requirements.</p>
    
    <p>Key features of BRIDGE include:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Dictionary Generation:</strong> BRIDGE automatically generates a data dictionary based on the selected questions. This data dictionary can be seamlessly uploaded to data collection platforms like REDCap, simplifying the data capture process.</li>
        <li><strong>Completion Guide:</strong> BRIDGE provides a relevant completion guide that assists researchers in accurately and consistently filling out the eCRFs. This ensures data integrity and reliability.</li>
        <li><strong>Paper-Like CRF:</strong> For situations where manual data entry is required, BRIDGE offers a paper-like Case Report Form (CRF) that can be printed. This CRF format resembles traditional paper forms for ease of use.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>By harnessing the capabilities of BRIDGE, researchers can efficiently design and implement data capture strategies for their studies, ultimately contributing to the advancement of biomedical research and epidemiology.</p>
