GENERAL GUIDANCE,"The CRF is designed to collect data obtained through examination, interview, review of hospital notes, or extraction from electronic health records.  Data may be collected prospectively or retrospectively if the patient is enrolled after the date of presentation to a health facility. "

GENERAL GUIDANCE,"Your institution may capture data: <br/>(a) on the ISARIC hosted REDCap database - contact ISARIC for access, <br/>(b) to a REDCap database hosted at your institution - contact ISARIC if you would like support to set this up, or<br/>(c) on a database or electronic health record system at your institution - contact ISARIC to support data mapping.  "
GENERAL GUIDANCE,"Participant Identification Numbers consist of a 5-digit site code and a 4-digit participant number. <br/>Please obtain a site code and register on the data management system by contacting ISARIC.  Participant numbers should be assigned sequentially for each site beginning with 0001 or in blocks, possibly including alpha characters, where useful.  E.g., Ward X will assign numbers from 0001 or A001 onwards and Ward Y will assign numbers from 5001 or B001 onwards."
GENERAL GUIDANCE,"For participants who return for re-admission to the same site, start a new form with a different Participant Identification Number. Please check ""YES-admitted previously to this facility"" in the RE-ADMISSION section. Enter as 2 separate records if you are using a REDCap (or similar) database. "
GENERAL GUIDANCE,"For participants who transfer between two sites that are both collecting data on this form, it is preferred to have the data entered by a single site as a single admission, under the same Participant Identification Number. When this is not possible, the first site should record ""Transfer to other facility"" as an OUTCOME, and the second site should start a new form with a new patient number and indicate ""YES-… then transferred to this facility"" in the RE-ADMISSION AND PREVIOUS PIN section.
