Meningitis is an inflammatory disease of the leptomeninges, the tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord, and is defined by an abnormal number of white blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within an appropriate clinical context and with or without supportive radiological findings. 
Encephalitis refers to inflammation of the brain. In comparison with meningitis, in encephalitis, abnormalities in brain function are expected, including altered mental status, motor or sensory deficits, altered behaviour and personality changes, and speech or movement disorders. It is defined by an altered mental status lasting ?24 hours along with two of the following criteria: documented fever ?38° C (100.4°F); white blood cell count (WBC) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ? 5/mm³; generalized or partial seizures not fully attributable to a preexisting seizure disorder; new onset of focal neurological findings; presence of compatible acute lesion on neuroimaging; abnormality on electroencephalography that is consistent with encephalitis and not attributable to another cause. As outlined by the 2013 International Encephalitis Consortium.
Seizures are defined as an intermittent abnormality of nervous system physiology characterised by a transient occurrence of sudden, violent, irregular movement of the body, caused by involuntary contraction of muscles due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. An established history of epilepsy is not required.
Stroke refers to a sudden loss of neurological function secondary to haemorrhage or ischemia in the brain parenchyma due to a vascular event. Stroke may be a clinical diagnosis, with or without supportive radiological findings.
Intracranial haemorrhage refers to haemorrhage/bleeding occurring within the skull. Intracranial haemorrhage encompasses four broad types of haemorrhage: epidural haemorrhage, subdural haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, and intraparenchymal haemorrhage.

This depletes the body of its platelets and coagulation factors, and there is an increased risk of haemorrhage systemic process producing both thrombosis and haemorrhage and can be acute or chronic. Diagnosis is suggested by the history, the clinical presentation, moderate to severe thrombocytopaemia (<100,000 platelets per microliter) and the presence of microangiopathic changes on the blood film. Acute DIC is confirmed by demonstrating increased thrombin generation (e.g. decreased fibrinogen) and increased fibrinolysis (e.g. elevated fibrin degredation products and D-dimer). The diagnosis of chronic DIC may be largely based upon evidence of microangiopathy on the blood film and increased levels of fibrin degredation products and particularly D-dimer.","Please indicate 'Yes', if this complication has been experienced anytime during hospitalisation.",SNOMED,"64779008, Blood coagulation disorder","C4229995, Coagulation disorder",1,1,1,1,

•	Respiratory symptoms must have begun within one week of a known clinical insult, or the patient must have new or worsening symptoms during the past week. 
•	Bilateral opacities consistent with pulmonary oedema must be present on a chest radiograph or computed tomographic (CT) scan. These opacities must not be fully explained by pleural effusions, lobar collapse, lung collapse, or pulmonary nodules. 
•	The patient’s respiratory failure must not be fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. An objective assessment (eg, echocardiography) to exclude hydrostatic pulmonary oedema is required if no risk factors for ARDS are present. 
•	A moderate to severe impairment of oxygenation must be present, as defined by the ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2). The severity of the hypoxaemia defines the severity of the ARDS: 
•	The severity of the hypoxaemia defines the severity of the ARDS: 
o	Mild ARDS – The PaO2/FiO2 is >200 mmHg, but ?300 mmHg, on ventilator settings that include positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ?5 cm H2O.
o	Moderate ARDS – The PaO2/FiO2 is >100 mmHg, but ?200 mmHg, on ventilator settings that include PEEP ?5 cm H2O.
o	Severe ARDS – The PaO2/FiO2 is ?100 mmHg on ventilator settings that include PEEP ?5 cm H2O.
To determine the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, the PaO2 is measured in mmHg and the FiO2 is expressed as a decimal between 0.21 and 1. As an example, if a patient has a PaO2 of 60 mmHg while receiving 60% oxygen, then the PaO2/FiO2 is 60/0.6 = 100 mmHg. 
To convert kPa to mmHg please multiply kPa by 7.5. As an example, if a patient has a kPa of 11, 11 X 7.5 = 82.5 mmHg.","Please indicate 'Yes', if this complication has been experienced anytime during hospitalisation.",SNOMED,"67782005, Acute respiratory distress","C1848829, Acute respiratory distress",1,1,1,1,
